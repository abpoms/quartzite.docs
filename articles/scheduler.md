## What version of Quartzite does this guide cover?

This guide covers Quartzite `1.0.x`.


## Overview

Quartz scheduler is a specialized database that stores jobs and triggers and executes the jobs according to trigger schedules. It may store its state
in a durable data store (like relational databases accessible via JDBC or [MongoDB](https://github.com/michaelklishin/quartz-mongodb)).

Quartz schedulers are also *event emitters*. It is possible to register listeners for various events (such as scheduler being paused or a trigger firing).
Schedulers can be extended in using 3rd party plugins.

Quartzite assumes that most application only ever use a single scheduler.


## Quartz scheduler lifecycle

Scheduler may be in one of the following states:

 * Not started
 * Started
 * In the standby mode (paused)
 * Shut down

These is not technically an exhaustive list but it gives you a good idea.

Before jobs can be submitted for execution, the scheduler has to be initialized with the `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/initialize` function:

{% gist aebee54cde1563207b19 %}

This function starts a an instance of Quartz scheduler that maintains a thread pool of non-daemon threads. Using this function in
the top-level namespace code is a **bad idea**: it will cause Leiningen tasks like `lein jar` to hang forever because Quartz threads will prevent
JVM from exiting.

When Quartzite scheduler is initialized, it does not trigger jobs until it is started using `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/start`. Very often this will happen on application start up:

{% gist 73a4649e06699246ff82 %}

To put scheduler into the standby mode, use `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/standby` function:

{% gist a3f8e626f49544658342 %}

When in the standby mode, scheduler is not active: triggers do not fire and as a consequence, no jobs are executed.

To shut down the scheduler, use `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/shutdown`:

{% gist b91dd8789d39d90aceb8 %}


Quartzite provides several predicate functions that let you determine current state of the  scheduler:

{% gist cb8e9ebf3a316ec21211 %}


To initialize a new scheduler after the previous one has been shut down, use `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/recreate`:

{% gist b1a7d0b2cbc2e615195b %}

Typically you only will recreate schedulers in the REPL or integration tests, it is almost never used in production.


## Quartz scheduler configuration

Quartzite relies on Quartz to handle configuration. Quartz uses a property file, `quartz.properties`, that needs to be on the classpath.
With [Leiningen 2](http://leiningen.org), you specify resource (non-code) file location using the `:resource-paths` key in `project.clj`:

{% gist 72f21c60a57f08f241af %}

Here is a minimalistic example of `quartz.properties`:

{% gist 1f1a672b1a403fb03e2e %}

A more involved example may use a custom durable store and one or more plugins:

{% gist 9a449f0af083d63a5330 %}

Please refer to the [Quartz Scheduler configuration reference](http://quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.x/configuration/) to learn more.


## Using multiple schedulers

Quartzite was created with applications that only ever use a single scheduler (the vast majority, in our opinion). To work with multiple schedulers,
you can rebind the dynamic var Quartzite uses to store its scheduler instance, `clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/*scheduler*`, using
`clojurewerkz.quartzite.scheduler/with-scheduler` convenience macro or `clojure.core/binding` directly. The var must be an atom.



## What to read next

The documentation is organized as a number of guides, covering all kinds of topics.

We recommend that you read the following guides first, if possible, in this order:

 * [Defining jobs](/articles/jobs.html)
 * [Defining triggers and schedules](/articles/triggers.html)
 * [Using persistent stores for scheduler state](/articles/persistent_quartz_stores.html)
 * [Using Quartz plugins](/articles/quartz_plugins.html)
